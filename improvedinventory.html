		<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
		<p>This mod adds new behaviors to Minecraft&#39;s inventory and HUD, which can each be toggled independently using config.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Slot Cycle: Allows the player to cycle the active hotbar slot with a different item in the same column using keybinds. </li>
			<li>Durability Display: Displays the durability of equipped armor on the screen.</li>
			<li>Stack Refill: Repopulates stacks of items in the hotbar with matching ones from the inventory.</li>
			<li>Tool Selection: Automatically switchs to the most effective tool for the targeted block or entity.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>I am not currently planning on adding more content to this mod. However, feel free to suggest new behaviors through GitHub&#39;s feature request system, and I may consider adding them.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Will this be updated to 1.x.x?</em> - Yes! I plan on updating this mod for as long as I can. Expect to wait a few weeks after major Minecraft updates for an updated version of this mod. There may be longer pauses between minor versions depending on how busy I am.</li>
			<li><em>Will you make a Forge version?</em> - No. I don&#39;t make Forge mods, but feel free to make your own (unofficial) port as long as you credit me for any code borrowed from this mod.</li>
			<li><em>Can I use this in my mod pack?</em> - Yes! I made this mod for people to use!</li>
